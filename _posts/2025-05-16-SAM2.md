### ðŸ“Š Summary Comparison

| Feature               | **SAM (2023)**                             | **SAM2 (2024)**                              |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Inference Speed**   | Slow (large ViT backbone)                  | âœ… Up to **30Ã— faster**, suitable for real-time |
| **Architecture**      | Heavy ViT-H model (~632M params)           | âœ… **Lightweight design** with sparse attention |
| **Accuracy**          | Strong, but struggles with small objects   | âœ… Improved **mask precision**, especially for small objects |
| **Prompt Types**      | Point, Box, Mask                           | âœ… Potential for **text & multimodal prompts** |
| **Input Modalities**  | Static images only                         | âœ… Extended to **videos, multi-scale inputs** |
| **Deployment**        | Cloud & research-focused                   | âœ… Suitable for **mobile, edge devices**       |

### ðŸ§¬ Technical Highlights

1. **Optimized Backbone**  
   Replaces bulky ViT with **sparse and efficient architectures**, enabling faster inference without significant accuracy loss.

2. **Faster Prompt Response**  
   Interactive use cases now benefit from **low-latency segmentation**.

3. **Better Multi-Scale Object Handling**  
   Enhanced performance for **small objects** and high-resolution inputs.

4. **Multimodal Readiness** *(in progress)*  
   Designed to work more easily with **textual prompts or other modalities**, aligning with the trend of grounding models (e.g., Grounded-SAM, GLIGEN).

### âœ… Conclusion

- **SAM2 retains or improves upon SAM's accuracy** while offering **dramatic speed and efficiency gains**.
- It is designed to move segmentation from cloud-bound systems into **real-time, mobile-friendly applications**.
